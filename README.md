# Shopping List app

Check out my solution for the exercise from lecture 133 of the course Web developer zero to mastery on Udemy :). Built using plain Javascript, HTML and CSS.
The user is able to add items to the shopping list, cross them out, remove, as well as clear the entire list.
In the backend, I've used NodeJs, Express and SQLite database to storing the items.
